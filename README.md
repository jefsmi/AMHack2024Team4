# Acumatica Hackathong 2024 - Team 4 - Sustainable Shippers
How often have your received a very large box with a very small amount of actual product in it?  And then the shipper just threw a ton of bubble wrap into the box to fill it up.  Probably ever time you've ordered something.  

Such a waste of material that just ends up in the trash.

Sustainable Shippers is the start of a helping your packers efficiently pack their boxes and guide them in how they should also safely package them including the packaging material.  Packing more efficiently and using less boxes leads to a savings in both materials and time.

We utilize this by calling it to find the most efficient ways to pack the first box with all the conatiner options and all the items.  We then take that best box and use that in Acumatica and run through the routine multiple times until all items are packed.
